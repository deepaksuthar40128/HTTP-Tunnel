# HTTP Tunnel
This is acting as proxy between my `AWS-EC2` container url and client browser

## ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ Dont Use ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
If there is something personal information passing through your routes avoid using this proxy becouse half of the route of this proxy is on `HTTP`

### Easy way to assign free subdomain to AWS EC2 or Azure Container Service.
### For fun only.
